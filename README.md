# RTSyn Plugin Loader

The loader accepts a built shared library, a module root directory, or a module
root `xmake.lua`. Module roots are configured and built with Xmake before the
generated shared library is opened.

When a module root is used, the loader runs:

```bash
xmake f -y --mode=release
xmake build -y
```

The Xmake executable can be overridden with:

```bash
export RTSYN_XMAKE_BIN=/path/to/xmake
```

After building, the loader searches the module `build` directory for a shared
library, skips Xmake package caches, and prefers the shared library whose target
name matches the module root directory.

## Usage

### Update

Make sure you have last version of the dependencies:

```bash
xrepo update-repo
xmake require --upgrade
```

For development you may need to run:

```bash
xmake require --upgrade -fy <dependency_name>
```

### Compiling

For compiling:

```bash
xmake
```

### Tests

For running test:

```bash
xmake test
```

For enabling valgrind, before running tests:

```bash
xmake f --valgrind=y
```

For disabling valgrind, just replace `y` for `n`.

### Local development

If you want to test your changes locally from different parts of RTSyn, export the path where you have all the repos:

```bash
export RTSYN_WORKSPACE=<PATH>
```

> [!WARNING]
> This expects you also the `rtsyn-xmake-repo`.

### Cleaning

To remove all generated build artifacts:

```bash
xmake clean --all
```

To also reset cached configuration and tool detection:

```bash
xmake f -c
```
